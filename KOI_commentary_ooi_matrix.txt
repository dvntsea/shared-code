notes from correlation matrix of KOI data:
-a lot is highly significant
-a few stand out cases:
	the most significant correlations are with Teff (temperature), log.g. (gravity of the planet)
	r.R. and a.R. may generally be variables of interest:
		r.R.: ratio of planet radius to stellar radius
		a.R.: the distance between the planet and the star a mid-transit divided by the stellar radius
	Age of object highly correlated with (correlation coefficients in paren, all p<.001):
		 duration (-.1) - transit duration
		 planet radius (-.06)
		 Teq (-.14)- Equilibrium surface temperature of planet
		 teff (-.59)- Stellar effective (photospheric) temperature in degrees K
		 Stellar Radius (-.20)
		 Stellar Mass (-.57)
