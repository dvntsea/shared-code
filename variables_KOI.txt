KEPLER_KOI
Search results output columns:

Kepler ID
    Kepler ID identifying corresponding entry in the Kepler Input Catalog (or custom aperture number).
    range: 757,076 to < 13 million

Time of Transit Epoch
    Time to first transit (BKJD = BJD-2454833.0). The offset corresponds to 12:00 on Jan 1, 2009 UTC. 
	Note other tables have used an offset value of 2454900, so be careful when comparing entries with earlier data.
    120.5 to 657.3

Period
    Average interval between transits based on a linear fit to all observed transits. 
	For candidates with only one observed transit, the period is estimated from the duration and knowledge of the stellar radius; 
	values are then rounded to the nearest integer and multiplied by -1.
    0.29 to 201292

Transit Depth
    The fraction of stellar flux lost (in parts per million) at the minimum of the planetary transit. 
	Transit depths are typically computed from a best-fit model produced by a Mandel-Agol (2002) model fit to 
	a multi-quarter Kepler light curve, assuming a linear orbital ephemeris.
    14 to 297000 ppm

Duration
    Transit duration, first contact to last contact. Contact times are typically computed from a best-fit model produced
	 by a Mandel-Agol (2002) model fit to a multi-quarter Kepler light curve, assuming a linear orbital ephemeris.
    0.35 to 60.03

Ingress Duration
    The time between first and second contact of the planetary transit. Contact times are typically computed from a best-fit
	 model produced by a Mandel-Agol (2002) model fit to a multi-quarter Kepler light curve, assuming a linear orbital ephemeris.
    all null

Impact Parameter
    The sky-projected distance between the center of the stellar disc and the center of the planet disc at conjunction, 
	normalized by the stellar radius.
    0 to 3.49

Inclination
    The angle between the plane of the sky (perpendicular to the line of sight) and the orbital plane of the planet candidate.
    9.74 to 89.95

Semi-major Axis
    Semi-major axis for planet based on Kepler 3rd law.
    0 to 63.9

Eccentricity
    Eccentricity.
    all zeroes

r/R
    Ratio of planet radius to stellar radius
    0.004 to 2.78

a/R
    The distance between the planet and the star at mid-transit divided by the stellar radius. For the case of zero orbital 
	eccentricity, the distance at mid-transit is the semi-major axis of the planetary orbit.
    0.2 to 31021

Planet Radius
    Planetary radius; in Earth radii=6378 km
    0.32 to 294

Teq
    Equilibrium surface temperature of planet. The calculation of equilibrium temperature assumes i) thermodynamic equilibrium 
	between the incident stellar flux and the radiated heat from the planet, ii) a Bond albedo (the fraction of total power 
	incident upon the planet scattered back into space) of 0.3, iii) that the planet and star are blackbodies, and iv) that 
	the heat is evenly distributed between the day and night sides of the planet.
    31 to 9721

Teff
    Stellar effective (photospheric) temperature in degrees K
    3240 to 27740

log(g)
    Log of stellar surface gravity in cm/s2
    1.63 to 4.98

Metallicity
    stellar metallicity (dex). The base-10 logarithm of the Fe to H ratio at the surface of the star, normalized by the solar Fe to H ratio.
    all null

Stellar Radius
    stellar photospheric radius (solar = 1)
    0.27 to 25.7

Stellar Mass
    stellar Mass (solar = 1)
    all null
	
Age
    stellar Age
    0 to 14


Quarters
    bit-map of quarters searched. A bit string indicating which quarters of Kepler data were searched for transit signatures. 
	Reading from left to right, the bits indicate the quarters. A value of one for any bit means that the designated quarter 
	was searched for transits, a value of zero means that quarter was not included in the transit search.
    all null
KOI count
    Number of planet candidates identified in system
    1 to 6

Binary Discrimination
    Binary discrimination odd-even depth significance. See NExSci data columns definitions page for more information.
    0 to 158.4
