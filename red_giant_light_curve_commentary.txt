Red Giant Light Curves
-converted to .csv from .fits files using TOPCAT (NASA-used)
-pulled 8 curves, can pull/convert more if necessary
-to produce scatter plot, plot TIME (col 1) against SAP_FLUX (simple aperture photometry - info below)

The light curve is produced using simple aperture photometry (SAP). 
The light curve files contain two light curves. The SAP light curve is the flux in units 
of electrons per second contained in the optimal aperture pixels collected by the spacecraft. 
This light curve is the output of the PA module in the SOC pipeline. The PDCSAP light curve 
is the flux contained in the optimal aperture in electrons per second after the PDC module 
has applied its detrending algorithm to the PA light curve. 

-for the eight light curves pulled, SAP_FLUX over time looked quite different for the different stars - 
-some decreased linearly over time, while others were semi periodic
-plots available in accompanying folder
